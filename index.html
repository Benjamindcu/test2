      <h3>Move to Zero Initiative</h3>
      <p>
        At the core of Nike's sustainability efforts is its "Move to Zero"
        campaign, which aims to achieve zero carbon emissions and zero waste
        across the company's </P> <p> global operations. This ambitious initiative
        encompasses various aspects of Nike's business, including:
      </p>
      <!-- key area about Nike Sustainability-->
      <ul>
        <li>Reducing carbon emissions across the supply chain</li>
        <li>Minimizing waste throughout the product lifecycle</li>
        <li>Transitioning to renewable energy sources</li>
        <li>Embracing circular economy principles</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Sustainable Materials and Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        Nike has recognized that materials account for about 70% of its carbon
        footprint, making this a crucial focus area. The company has made
        significant progress in incorporating sustainable materials into its</P> <p>
        products:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nike apparel labeled as "sustainable materials" contains at least 50%
          recycled content
        </li>
        <li>
          The company has repurposed the equivalent of 5 billion plastic bottles
          into high-performance athletic wear
        </li>
        <li>
          Nike is actively working on developing innovative materials with lower
          carbon footprints
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Supply Chain and Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>
        Nike's vast global supply chain presents both challenges and
        opportunities for sustainability. The company is addressing this
        through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Supplier Climate Action Program (SCAP), which supports suppliers
          in reducing their climate impact
        </li>
        <li>
          Encouraging suppliers to increase renewable energy use and set their
          own climate targets
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementing waste reduction strategies at all levels of the supply
          chain
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Recycling and Circular Economy</h3>
      <p>Nike has implemented several programs to promote circularity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Recycling + Donation program accepts used athletic shoes and
          clothing for recycling or donation
        </li>
        <li>
          Nike Grind, an initiative started in 1992, repurposes old shoes to
          create new products and surfaces
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Water Conservation and Chemical Management</h3>
      <p>Nike is also focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reducing water usage, particularly in cotton cultivation and
          manufacturing processes
        </li>
        <li>Eliminating hazardous chemicals from its production processes</li>
      </ul>
